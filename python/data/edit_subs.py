# pysubs2 is a Python library for editing subtitle files. Itâ€™s based on SubStation Alpha, the native format of Aegisub; it also supports SubRip (SRT), MicroDVD, MPL2, TMP and WebVTT formats and OpenAI Whisper captions.

# Open the SRT file
subs = pysubs2.load("subtitle.srt")

# Print the subtitle text and start/end times
for line in subs:
    print(line.text)
    print(line.start, line.end)
