"""
Clean up subtitles csv file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming the CSV data is stored in a file called data.csv, this script reads
the file using the csv module, which is part of Python's standard library.
The data is stored in a list of lists, where each inner list
represents a row of the CSV file.

The script then joins the non-empty cells of each row with spaces
to create a single line of text, and adds a double newline to separate
each line into paragraphs. The final result is stored in the paragraph
variable and printed to the console.

Note that this script assumes that the CSV file uses commas as separators
and double quotes as quote characters. You may need to adjust the delimiter
and quotechar arguments of the csv.reader function to match the format of
your CSV data.
